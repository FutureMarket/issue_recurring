## Motivation

This plugin has been inspired and based on [nutso's](https://github.com/nutso/) plugin [redmine-plugin-recurring-tasks](https://github.com/nutso/redmine-plugin-recurring-tasks). Thank you __nutso__! The code though was rewritten from scratch. It was due to amount of changes would make it impossible to fit into original codebase.

## Purpose

Plugin for Redmine to configure issue recurring according to a schedule. The plugin creates a new issue in Redmine for each new recurrence.
